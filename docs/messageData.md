# Introduction

**RPC Message** > **Query** > **Publish** > **Message** > **Message data**

A `Message` (see [protocol.md](protocol.md)) contains a special `data` field.
This field contains a serialized `Message data` message. A `Message data`
targets an `Object` and an `Action`. The `Object` can be seen as a class, and
the `Action` as a method. We represent this tuple (Object, Action) as a string
`<Object>#<Action>`.

Here are the existing `Message data`, identified by their unique
`<Object>#<Action>` attributes:

* lao#create
* lao#update_properties
* lao#state
* message#witness
* meeting#create
* meeting#state
* roll_call#create
* roll_call#open
* roll_call#close
* roll_call#reopen

## Creating a LAO (lao#create)

By sending the lao/create message to the organizer‚Äôs server‚Äôs default channel
(‚Äú/root‚Äù), the main channel of the LAO will be created with the identifier id.
At that point, any of the clients, including the organizer, can subscribe to the
channel id and send messages over it. The server is expected to verify the data,
such that the last modified timestamp is equal to the creation timestamp, that
the timestamp is reasonably recent with respect to the server‚Äôs clock, that the
attestation is valid, etc. Upon successful creation, the organizer is expected
to broadcast the LAO state to all witnesses and clients (see ‚ÄúLAO state
broadcast‚Äù).

## Update LAO properties (lao#update_properties)

By sending the lao/update_properties message to the LAO‚Äôs main channel (LAO's
‚Äúid‚Äù), the LAO name, list of witnesses and last modified timestamp are updated.
The server is expected to forward the message to the witnesses and clients. The
server is expected to verify the data, including timestamp freshness. Upon
successful modification, the organizer is expected to broadcast the LAO state to
all witnesses and clients (see ‚ÄúLAO state broadcast‚Äù).

## LAO state broadcast (lao#state)

When a LAO is created or modified, the organizer is expected to publish the
lao/state message to the LAO‚Äôs main channel (LAO's ‚Äúid‚Äù), once it has received
the required number of witness signatures.

## Witness a message (message#witness)

By sending the message/witness message to the LAO‚Äôs main channel (LAO's ‚Äúid‚Äù), a
witness can attest to the message. Upon reception, the server and the witnesses
add this signature to the existing message‚Äôs `witness_signatures` field. When a
new client retrieves this message, the `witness_signatures` field will be
populated with all the witness signatures received by the server.

## Creating a Meeting (meeting#create)

üß≠ **RPC Message** > **RPC payload** (*Query*) > **Query payload** (*Publish*) >

By sending the meeting/create message to the LAO‚Äôs main channel (LAO's ‚Äúid‚Äù),
the meeting will be created with the identifier `id`. The server is expected to
verify the data, such that the last modified timestamp is equal to the creation
timestamp, that the timestamp is reasonably recent with respect to the server‚Äôs
clock, that the attestation is valid, etc. Upon successful creation, the server
is expected to broadcast the Meeting state to all witnesses and clients (see
‚ÄúMeeting state broadcast‚Äù).

## Roll Calls (introduction)

A roll call has the following state transitions:

Created ‚Üí Opened ‚Üí Closed ‚Üí Reopened ‚Üí Closed

**Created**: This states denotes the organizers intention of organizing a new
roll call.  
**Opened**: This state denotes that the roll call is open and the organizer and
**witnesses** are ready to scan the QR code(s) of the attendees.  
**Closed**: This state denotes the closing of a roll call and contains all the
**attendee** public keys scanned during the roll call process.  

## Creating a Roll-Call (roll_call#create)

üß≠ **RPC Message** > **RPC payload** (*Query*) > **Query payload** (*Publish*) >
**Mid Level** > **High level** (*roll_call#create*)

An organizer creates a roll-call by publishing a roll_call/create message to the
LAO‚Äôs channel. The proposed_start and proposed_end fields denote the start and
end time for the roll call. Note that these fields are only used to position the
event correctly in the list of LAO events. Witnesses witness the roll call event
ensuring that each attendee is scanned exactly once.

## Opening a Roll-Call (roll_call#open)

A roll-call may be opened by the organizer by publishing a roll_call/open
message on the LAO channel.

    ]
}

```

## Closing a Roll-Call (roll_call#close)

A roll-call may be closed by the organizer by publishing a roll_call/close
message on the LAO channel. This is effectively the message that will be sent by
the organizer after scanning all attendees‚Äô public key.

## Reopening a Roll-Call (roll_call#reopen)

A closed roll-call may be re-opened by the organizer by publishing a
roll_call/reopen message on the LAO channel. This is useful in scenarios where
the organizer forgets to scan an attendee‚Äôs public key.
