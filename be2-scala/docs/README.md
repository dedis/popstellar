# PoP Scala backend

This repository contains the **scala server side implementation** of the PoP project.


## 1.	Getting Started

We assume that you're familiar with the PoP project. Please read the [Architecture Specifications](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19r3rP6o8TO-xeZBM0GQzkHYQFSJtWy7UhjLhzzZVry4) to get an idea about all the actors and components in the system.


### Resources

The code heavily relies on the principles of **actors** and **streams**. The first one is implemented using standard akka actors, whereas the latter uses akka DSL flow graphs. Finally, we use **spray-json** in order to properly encode/decode JSON messages.

- [Scala documentation](https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/api/2.13.1/)
- [Akka actors](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/index.html)
- [Akka streams (DSL graphs)](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/stream/stream-graphs.html)
- [Spray-json](https://github.com/spray/spray-json): simple parsing library

Keep in mind that the [Pre-semester work project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gGRNVSKO4NGe2zzvVs28qJzkoMgIScq1iAQQct980pg) is a good tutorial to get familiar with both [WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) and [Akka HTTP](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/index.html)


### IDE/Editors

The two most common Scala IDEs are VSCode and IntelliJ. Both are viable since we are using Scala version *2.13.x* (< 3.x).

## 3.	Architecture

The PoP Scala backend is used by LAO organizers and witnesses in order to store and validate LAO information/participation. A simplified version of the project is as follows: clients (either organizers, witnesses, or attendees) may connect to the server using WebSockets in order to "read" or "write" information on a database depending on their role in the LAO.

</div>


In more details, the whole backend is a giant [DSL graph](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/stream/stream-graphs.html) (see image below). Whenever a new request is received (blue "Source" circle), a new `ClientActor` is automatically created for each new client. This actor *represents the fundamental link between a particular client and the server*; any message sent to the actor will arrive directly in the client's mailbox.

The `ClientActor` then transmits data destined for the server directly to a partitioner for further examination. This partitioner will decide which path a particular message will follow (e.g. a JSON-rpc query will not be treated the same way as a JSON-rpc response).

Once the message has been processed (e.g. LAO created if the message is valid or reject the request if it is not valid or does not follow our custom JSON-rpc protocol), the assigned handler (green and orange boxes) asks the `AnswerGenerator` to inform the client whether the operation was successful or not.

</div>


If we look even closer, here is how the real be2 DSL graph is designed.

Between the `ClientActor` and the partitioner sits a module which goal is to validate conformity with our custom JSON-rcp protocol, decode the JSON payload, and then finally validate its fields.

The partitioner decides which path a message is supposed to take depending on its content; more precisely, depending on if it contains a "params" field or not. Further down the line, a handler is used for each type of message (e.g. the LAO handler is able to understand and process LAO messages such as `CreateLao`, `StateLao`, and `UpdateLao`)

The results are then collected by the main merger (blue "merger" circle) and sent to the `AnswerGenerator`. An answer (`JsonRpcResponse`) is created and sent back to the `ClientActor` (and thus the real client through WebSocket) by the `Answerer` module.

### Sending and Receiving Messages

??? Explain ClientActor?

### Message Definition

All objects referred to in the protocol specification (and the logic for parsing them)
are defined in `model/network` package, closely mirroring the JSON-Schema folder structure.

Please note that the JSON-RPC definitions in the root of the repository are to be considered
a source of truth since the validation library checks the messages against it.

:information_source: When you need to create a new object, please refer to existing message types and in particular
their `buildFromJson` method to get an idea about how to implement a new type. In order to tell the encoder/decoder how to encode/decode the new message (e.g. `buildFromJson`), its "recipe" must be added directly in the `json/MessageDataProtocol.scala` file.


### Spray-json Conversion

Whenever a new JSON-rpc message is added in the protocol, its encoding/decoding recipe should be added in this package. If the new message is a case class, spray-json is able to handle message conversion using `jsonFormatX`, where `X` corresponds to the number of parameters the case class has. For example,

```scala
case class A(i: Int, s: String)

implicit val format: RootJsonFormat[A] = jsonFormat2(A)
```

or

```scala
case class B(price: Double)
case class A(name: String, b: B)

implicit val formatB: RootJsonFormat[B] = jsonFormat1(B) // (1)
implicit val formatA: RootJsonFormat[A] = jsonFormat2(A) // (2)
```

Note that order matters! In order to convert `A`, (2) gets called. It first handles the `name` parameter (`String`) and then converts `b` (`B`). Thus the conversion for `B` (here (1)) has to be defined *above*.

:warning: Spray-json is *not* able to automatically convert "complex" types such as `Option[T]`, `Either[A, B]`, ... Examples of such cases are provided in the codebase.



On the other hand, if the new message is anything but a case class, you will need to specify the entire conversion by hand with the help of two methods: `read` (from JSON to internal representation) and `write` (from internal representation to JSON). Note that, once again, order matters. For example,

```scala
class Point(var x: Int, var y: Int) {}

implicit object Format extends RootJsonFormat[Point] {
	override def read(json: JsValue): Point = {
		json.asJsObject.getFields("x", "y") match {
			case Seq(JsNumber(x), JsNumber(y)) => Point(x.toInt, y.toInt)
			case _ => throw ...
		}
	}

	override def write(obj: Point): JsValue = JsObject(
		"x" -> obj.x,
		"y" -> obj.y
	)
}

```

Once again, a lot of examples of such cases are present within the codebase

:information_source: *tips*: always try to prioritize case classes whenever possible :)


### Validation

All the incoming messages are validated in a two-steps process using the `pubsub/graph/validators` package:
1. Check conformity with the custom JSON-rpc protocol using `[...]validators/Validator.scala:schemaValidator`;
2. Check information validity (e.g. correct signature) using the rest of the `[...]validators` package.

Each additional message constraint (e.g. in this particular case, "start_time" should always equal "end_time") is checked in the corresponding validator (e.g. `LaoValidator`) before the case class instance representing the message is created.

### Storage

We are using [leveldb](https://github.com/codeborui/leveldb-scala) in order to store messages "inside" channels. A channel is represented with a standard directory. In the following example, we have 3 distinct channels (e.g. `root/u9nHxKYQkx7PXawcqs0DHUGEuc9Xv_P6blf7HxcDUTk=`).

```
.
├── database
│   └── root
│       └── u9nHxKYQkx7PXawcqs0DHUGEuc9Xv_P6blf7HxcDUTk=
│           ├── /* ... db stuff ... */
│       └── wfbY_ni1IbF7ziacoGlh7J9aAP1ukG2BPccRe4Z8EUc=
│           ├── /* ... db stuff ... */
│       └── zoaPYwfl9YRKEgdngCC6StufvhXWuvy-09g7l-KjG5g=
│           ├── /* ... db stuff ... */
```

Multiple messages may then be stored inside each channel. Since leveldb is a key-value database, we are using `message_id` as key and the corresponding `message` (in its json representation) as value

```scala
val messageId: Hash = message.message_id

Try(channelDb.put(messageId.getBytes, message.toJsonString.getBytes)) match {
	case Success(_) =>
		log.info(s"Actor $self (db) wrote message_id '$messageId' on channel '$channel'")
		sender ! DbActorWriteAck
	case Failure(exception) =>
		log.info(s"Actor $self (db) encountered a problem while writing message_id '$messageId' on channel '$channel'")
		sender ! DbActorNAck(ErrorCodes.SERVER_ERROR.id, exception.getMessage)
}
```



You may store/fetch data on/from the database using a special unique database actor (`DbActor`) using standard [akka ask pattern](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/interaction-patterns.html#request-response). Akka messages `DbActor` understands are defined in `DbActor.scala:Event`, they include:

```scala
// DbActor Events correspond to messages the actor may receive
sealed trait Event

final case class Write(channel: Channel, message: Message) extends Event
final case class Read(channel: Channel, id: Hash) extends Event
```

`DbActor` will then answer using one of its predetermined answers defined within the same file:

```scala
// DbActor Events correspond to messages the actor may emit
sealed trait DbActorMessage

final case object DbActorWriteAck extends DbActorMessage
final case class DbActorReadAck(message: Option[Message]) extends DbActorMessage
final case class DbActorCatchupAck(messages: List[Message]) extends DbActorMessage
final case class DbActorNAck(code: Int, description: String) extends DbActorMessage
```

Here's an example (shamefully stolen from `MessageHandler.scala`) showing the power of `DbActor` coupled with Scala [Future](https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/api/2.13.1/scala/concurrent/Future.html)

```scala
val ask: Future[GraphMessage] = (dbActor ? DbActor.Write(channel, message)).map {
	case DbActorWriteAck => Left(rpcMessage)
	case DbActorNAck(code, description) => Right(PipelineError(code, description, rpcMessage.id))
	case _ => Right(PipelineError(
    ErrorCodes.SERVER_ERROR.id, "Database actor returned an unknown answer", rpcMessage.id)
	)
}

// Await.result waits for <duration> for the future <ask> to complete. It returns the value contained by the future (here `GraphMessage`) if the latter is successful, or throws if the Future terminates without being successful (i.e. either Failure or Timeout) 
Await.result(ask, duration)
```



:information_source: the database may easily be reset/purged by either deleting a folder corresponding to a channel or by deleting the `database` folder entirely


## 4.	Debugging Tips

The best way to "intercept" a `GraphMessage` being processed in the graph is to launch the server in debug mode, and then sending an isolated message to the server triggering the bug.

:information_source: [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/realtime/) (Realtime => WebSocket => `ws://localhost:8000/`) is a useful tool to achieve this result


## 5.	Coding Styles

A simple way to have a coherent style across the codebase is to use the IDE features of "code cleanup". For example, in IntelliJ, click on the `src/main/scala` folder and then on `Code -> Reformat Code`. You can then check "include subdirectories", "optimize imports", and "cleanup code" checkbox options. Be careful to not apply these changes to `src/test` folder as it transforms the scalatest syntax into a mess difficult to understand.

Moreover, check that your favorite editor is detecting & using the `.editorconfig` file at the root of the project
