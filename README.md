Proof-of-personhood, fall 2020: Protocol specification


_Most of the sub-folders have their own README detailing some general information about their layer._

Every "type" : "object" is described in more details in a sub-folder.

There might a way to avoid repeating all the wrapping information by using refs, but for now, it may be safer to just repeat it so that every json file is guaranteed to be complete.

# Introduction
The Personhood.Online system will communicate over WebSockets and rely on a Publish/Subscribe communication pattern, to support the Personhood.Online notion of “Communication channels” described in Data Pipeline architecture specification.
As WebSockets do not naturally support Publish/Subscribe, a low-level protocol is described to provide the Publish/Subscribe communication layer.
Building on top of this low-level protocol, a high-level protocol will provide the Personhood.Online application-level communication. This protocol is also described here.

## Validation and Disambiguation
To make sure that the protocol is understood by everyone equally and to ensure that it is implemented correctly, all messages will be described using the JSON Schema (proposed IETF standard). This will enable the teams to validate their inputs and outputs with the schema files as part of their testing strategy.
The JSON Schema description is not part of this document and will be provided in a dedicated branch of the project’s Github repository.

## Representation of complex data types in the protocol
Please note that || denotes a concatenation.

Hex: hexadecimal (base 16) in string format. Example: 0x5932
Public Key: Hex
Signature: Hex (Point 1) || Hex (Point 2). Example: 0x59...0x78...
Take the fields specified that the signature is supposed to be on, hash it and then call Sign API on the hash. Equivalent to Sign(Hash(content))
Hash: Hex
Encrypted Vote: ElGamal encryption of a message. Hex (Point 1) || Hex (Point 2)
Timestamp: uint64 representation of the Unix timestamp (seconds since January 1st, 1970)
