Everyone working on the project,
please create your own private "working" branches as needed
using the naming convention
`work-(fe*|be*|evoting|wallet|network)-<yourname>[-optional-variant]`.
For example,
a branch I create to contribute to the `fe1-web` project
might be called `work-fe1-bford` by default,
or `work-fe1-bford-random-experiment` if I need an additional temporary branch
for a random experiment for example.
As another example,
a branch I create to as part of my work on the `e-voting` project,
and which spans both a back-end and a front-end,
might be called `work-evoting-bford` by default,
or `work-evoting-bford-ballot-casting`
if I need a branch to develop the ballot casting feature.
