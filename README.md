# student20_pop
Proof-of-personhood, fall 2020

Note that the main work in this repository is to be done
in the context of the following front-end and back-end branches:

* [fe1-web](https://github.com/dedis/student20_pop/tree/fe1-web): Web-based front-end implementation in ReactJS
* [fe2-android](https://github.com/dedis/student20_pop/tree/fe2-android): Android native front-end implementation in Java or Scala (TBD)
* [fe3-ios](https://github.com/dedis/student20_pop/tree/fe3-ios): Optional iOS native front-end implementation in Swift
* [be1-go](https://github.com/dedis/student20_pop/tree/be1-go): Back-end implementation in Go
* [be2-go](https://github.com/dedis/student20_pop/tree/be2-scala): Back-end implementation in Scala

These branches were intentionally initialized as fresh Git repositories
with unrelated histories,
so that Git will complain about attempts to cross-merge them.
Please do not attempt merges from one branch to another (for now),
without careful consideration and discussion!
Treat them as if they were entirely separate and unrelated repositories for now.
We may develop a process for eventually merging them
into one ultimate, stable "master" repository
combining all the front-end and back-end builds, but that's for later if at all.
